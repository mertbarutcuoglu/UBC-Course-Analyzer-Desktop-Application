# Course Analyzer

## A quantitative approach for course selection.

### Proposal ###
- **What will the application do?  Who will use it?**

    As students, when choosing a course or deciding the section of a course, we always try to choose the one that looks 
    like the "easiest" one to get a good grade. Even though easiness of a course is a subjective concept, there are some 
    numerical data that can help us to make that decision, like previous averages, and grade distributions. However, 
    collecting this data is a time consuming process, and it is likely to do mistakes while collecting the data and 
    comparing it with the data of previous years. The purpose of this application is to automate this process and 
    provide useful insights into a course section that was provided by the user. Targeted users for this application are 
    UBC undergraduate students who try to choose one of the current sections of a course that they want to enroll. 
    To use the application, the user will input the subject area, course number, and the section number. After this,
    the application will get the data for the last five years, and filter it for the given section's professor, As 
    an output, the user will see the class average of the last five year for that section's professor, and other useful
    insights like grade distributions, pass rates, and data visualizations. Also, the user will be able to save these
    results in a list, therefore, the user will be able to compare the data for different sections and make a decision 
    based on this data.
